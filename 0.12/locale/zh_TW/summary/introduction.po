"PRQL is a modern language for transforming data — a simple, powerful, "
"pipelined SQL replacement. Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and "
"declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and "
"supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with "
"any database that uses SQL, since it compiles to SQL."
msgstr ""
"PRQL 是一種用於變換資料的現代語言 — 一個簡單、強大且採用管道化設計的 SQL 替代"
"方案。與 SQL 一樣，它具備易讀性、明確性且屬於宣告型語言。與 SQL 不同的是，它"
"構建了一個邏輯上的變換管道，並支援變數與函式等抽象概念。由於它可以編譯為 "
"SQL，因此適用於任何使用 SQL 的資料庫。"
