"Functions are a fundamental abstraction in PRQL — they allow us to run code "
"in many places that we've written once. This reduces the number of errors in "
"our code, makes our code more readable, and simplifies making changes."

"This function is named `interp`, and has two positional parameters named "

msgid ""
"Consistent with the principles of PRQL, it's possible to pipe values into "
"functions, which makes composing many functions more readable. When piping a "
"value into a function, the value is passed as an argument to the final "
"positional parameter of the function. Here's the same result as the examples "
"above with an alternative construction:"
