msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:5
msgid ""
"**Lexing & Parsing**: PRQL source text is split into tokens with the Chumsky "
"parser named \"lexer\". The stream of tokens is then parsed into an Abstract "
"Syntax Tree (AST)."

"**Semantic Analysis**: This stage resolves names (identifiers), extracts "
"declarations, and determines frames (table columns in each step). A "
"`Context` is declared containing the root module, which maps accessible "
"names to their declarations."
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:14
msgid "The resolving process involves the following operations:"
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:16
msgid "Assign an ID to each node (`Expr` and `Stmt`)."
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:17
msgid ""
"Extract function declarations and variable definitions into the appropriate "
"`Module`, accessible from `Context::root_mod`."
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:19
msgid ""
"Look up identifiers in the module and find the associated declaration. The "
"identifier is replaced with a fully qualified name that guarantees a unique "
"name in `root_mod`. In some cases, `Expr::target` is also set."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Convert function calls to transforms (`from`, `derive`, `filter`) from "
"`FuncCall` to `TransformCall`, which is more convenient for later processing."
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:25
msgid ""
"Determine the type of expressions. If an expression is a reference to a "
"table, use the frame of the table as the type. If it is a `TransformCall`, "
"apply the transform to the input frame to obtain the resulting type. For "
"simple expressions, try to infer from `ExprKind`."

"**Lowering**: This stage converts the PL into RQ, which is more strictly "
"typed and contains less information but is convenient for translating into "
"SQL or other backends."
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:34
msgid ""
"**SQL Backend**: This stage converts RQ into SQL. Each relation is "
"transformed into an SQL query. Pipelines are analyzed and split into "
"\"AtomicPipelines\" at appropriate positions, which can be represented by a "
"single SELECT statement."
msgstr ""

#: src/internals/compiler-architecture.md:39
msgid ""
"Splitting is performed back-to-front. First, a list of all output columns is "
"created. The pipeline is then traversed backwards, and splitting occurs when "
"an incompatible transform with those already present in the pipeline is "
"encountered. Splitting can also be triggered by encountering an expression "
"that cannot be materialized where it is used (e.g., a window function in a "
"WHERE clause)."

"This process is also called anchoring, as it anchors a column definition to "
"a specific location in the output query."
