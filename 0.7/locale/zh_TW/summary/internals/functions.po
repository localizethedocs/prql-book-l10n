"The major distinction between PRQL and today's conventional programming "
"languages such as C or Python is the function call syntax. It consists of "
"the function name followed by arguments separated by whitespace."

"If one of the arguments is also a function call, it must be encased in "
"parentheses, so we know where arguments of inner function end and the "
"arguments of outer function start."

"如果其中一個引數也是函式呼叫，它必須用括號括起來，這樣我們才能知道內部函式的"
"引數在哪裡結束，外部函式的引數在哪裡開始。"

"There is a alternative way of calling functions: using a pipeline. "
"Regardless of whether the pipeline is delimited by pipe symbol `|` or a new "
"line, the pipeline is equivalent to applying each of functions as the last "
"argument of the next function."
msgstr ""
"有另一種呼叫函式的方式：使用管道。無論管道是由管道符號 `|` 還是新行分隔，管道"
"相當於將每個函式作為下一個函式的最後一個引數應用。"

"As you can see, the first example with pipeline notation is much easier to "
"comprehend, compared to the last one with the regular function call "
"notation. This is why it is recommended to use pipelines for nested function "
