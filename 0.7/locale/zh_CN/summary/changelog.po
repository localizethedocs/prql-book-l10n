"At the end of January, we published a proposal of a better language for data "
"transformation: PRQL. The reception was better than I could have hoped for — "
"we were no. 2 on HackerNews for a day, and gained 2.5K GitHub stars over the "
"next few days."
msgstr ""

#: src/changelog.md:898
msgid ""
"But man cannot live on GitHub Stars alone — we had to do the work to build "
"it. So over the next several months, during many evenings & weekends, a "
"growing group of us gradually built the compiler, evolved the language, and "
"wrote some integrations."

"We want to double-down on the community and its roots in open source — it's "
"incredible that a few of us from all over the globe have collaborated on a "
"project without ever having met. We decided early-on that PRQL would always "
"be open-source and would never have a commercial product (despite lots of "
"outside interest to fund a seed round!). Because languages are so deep in "
"the stack, and the data stack has so many players, the best chance of "
"building a great language is to build an open language."

#: src/changelog.md:913

"We still have a long way to go. While PRQL is usable, it has lots of missing "
"features, and an incredible amount of unfulfilled potential, including a "
"language server, cohesion with databases, and type inference. Over the "
"coming weeks, we'd like to grow the number of intrepid users experimenting "
"PRQL in their projects, prioritize features that will unblock them, and then "
"start fulfilling PRQL's potential by working through our [roadmap](https://"
"prql-lang.org/roadmap/)."
