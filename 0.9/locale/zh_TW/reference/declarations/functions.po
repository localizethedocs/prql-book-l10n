"Consistent with the principles of PRQL, it's possible to pipe values into "
"functions, which makes composing many functions more readable. When piping a "
"value into a function, the value is passed as an argument to the final "
"positional parameter of the function. Here's the same result as the examples "
"above with an alternative construction:"
