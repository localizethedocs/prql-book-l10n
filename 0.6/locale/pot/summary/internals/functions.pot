"The major distinction between PRQL and today's conventional programming "
"languages such as C or Python is the function call syntax. It consists of "
"the function name followed by arguments separated by whitespace."

"If one of the arguments is also a function call, it must be encased in "
"parentheses, so we know where arguments of inner function end and the "
"arguments of outer function start."

"There is a alternative way of calling functions: using a pipeline. "
"Regardless of whether the pipeline is delimited by pipe symbol `|` or a new "
"line, the pipeline is equivalent to applying each of functions as the last "
"argument of the next function."

"As you can see, the first example with pipeline notation is much easier to "
"comprehend, compared to the last one with the regular function call "
"notation. This is why it is recommended to use pipelines for nested function "
"calls that are 3 or more levels deep."
