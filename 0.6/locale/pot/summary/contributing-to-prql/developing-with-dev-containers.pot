"[Dev Containers](https://containers.dev/) are a way to package a number of "
"developer tools (compilers, bundlers, package managers, loaders, etc.) into "
"a single object. This is helpful when many people want to contribute to a "
"project: each person only has to install the Dev Container on their own "
"machine to start working. By definition, the Dev Container has a consistent "
"set of tools that are known to work together. This avoids a fuss with "
"finding the proper version of each of the build tools."
