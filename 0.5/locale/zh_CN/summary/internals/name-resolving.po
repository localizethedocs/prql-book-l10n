"In PRQL, names in the scope are composed from namespace and variable name "

"In pipelines (or rather in transform functions), scope is also injected with "
"namespaces of tables which may have been referenced with `from` or `join` "
"transforms. These namespaces contain simply all the columns of the table and "
"possibly a wildcard variable, which matches any variable (see the algorithm "
"below). Within transforms, there is also a special namespace that does not "
"have a name. It is called a _\"frame\"_ and it contains columns of the "
"current table the transform is operating on."

"But when there are multiple tables and we don't have complete knowledge of "
