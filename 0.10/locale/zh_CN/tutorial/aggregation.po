"A key feature of analytics is reducing many values down to some summary. "
"This act is called \"aggregation\" and always includes a function — for "
"example, `average` or `sum` — that reduces values in the table to a single "
"row."

"The `aggregate` transform takes a tuple to create one or more new columns "

"`aggregate` can produce multiple summaries at once when one or more "

"In the example above, the result is a single row with two columns. The "
"`count` function displays the number of rows in the table that was passed "

"The `group` transform separates the table into groups (say, those having the "
