"PRQL is a modern language for transforming data — a simple, powerful, "
"pipelined SQL replacement. Like SQL, it's readable, explicit and "
"declarative. Unlike SQL, it forms a logical pipeline of transformations, and "
"supports abstractions such as variables and functions. It can be used with "
"any database that uses SQL, since it transpiles to SQL."
