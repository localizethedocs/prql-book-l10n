"This is a thin wrapper around the fantastic [IPython-sql](https://github.com/"
"catherinedevlin/ipython-sql) magic. Roughly speaking, all we do is parse "
"PRQL to SQL and pass that through to `ipython-sql`. A full documentation of "
"the supported features is available at their [repository](https://github.com/"
"catherinedevlin/ipython-sql). Here, we document those places where we differ "
"from them, plus those features we think you are mostly likely to find useful."
