"PRQL manipulates relations (tables) of data. The `derive`, `select`, and "
"`join` transforms change the number of columns in a table. The first two "
"never affect the number of rows in a table. `join` may change the number of "
"rows, depending on the variation chosen."

"This final example combines the above into a single query. It illustrates _a "
"pipeline_ - the fundamental basis of PRQL. We simply add new lines "
"(transforms) at the end of the query. Each transform modifies the relation "
"produced by the statement above to produce the desired result."
