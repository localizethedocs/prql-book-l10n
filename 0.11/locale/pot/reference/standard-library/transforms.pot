"Transforms were designed with a focus on modularity, so each of them is "
"fulfilling a specific purpose and has defined invariants (properties of the "
"relation that are left unaffected). That's often referred to as "
"\"orthogonality\" and its goal is to keep transform functions composable by "
"minimizing interference of their effects. Additionally, it also keeps the "
"number of transforms low."

"For example, `select` and `derive` will not change the number of rows, while "

"In SQL, we can see this lack of invariant when an aggregation function is "
"used in the `SELECT` clause. Before, the number of rows was kept constant, "
"but introduction of an aggregation function caused the whole statement to "
"produce only one row (per group)."
